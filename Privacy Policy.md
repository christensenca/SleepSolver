## <u>Data Collection Practices</u>

<u>We do not collect or store Your health data, and any limited Personal Data or Usage Data, if collected, is handled as described below. By using the Service, You consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy, including any potential transfer of Personal Data to the United States, if applicable.</u>

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Health Data

As of the date of this Privacy Policy, all health and fitness data You permit Us to access from Third-Party Applications, such as Apple’s HealthKit, is processed and stored directly on Your Device. We do not collect, store, or have access to such health data. Accordingly, We cannot provide customer support or services related to Your health data. Any references to collecting, using, or sharing Your Personal Data in this Privacy Policy apply to non-health data only, if applicable (e.g., Usage Data).

#### Personal Data

We do not collect personally identifiable information, such as Your name, email address, or contact details, unless You voluntarily provide it (e.g., when contacting Us via email). For subscriptions or in-app purchases, payment information is handled by Apple’s In-App Purchase system, and We do not access or store it.

#### Usage Data

We may collect limited Usage Data automatically when You use the Service, such as device type, operating system, or crash reports, to improve the Service’s performance. This data is anonymized and does not identify You personally. If We use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Apple’s crash reporting), such data may be processed by Service Providers, as described below.

### Use of Your Personal Data

If We collect any Personal Data or Usage Data, We may use it for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain our Service, including monitoring performance and fixing issues.
- To manage Your Account, if You create one, to access Service functionalities.
- To manage Your requests, such as responding to Your inquiries via email.
- For other purposes, such as analyzing usage trends to improve the Service, using anonymized data.

### Sharing of Your Personal Data

We do not share Your health data, as it remains on Your Device. If We collect non-health Personal Data or Usage Data, We may share it in the following situations:

- With Service Providers, such as analytics providers, to monitor and improve the Service, subject to strict confidentiality agreements.
- For business transfers, such as during a merger or acquisition, where Your data (if any) may be transferred with notice.
- With Your consent, for any other purpose You explicitly approve.

### Retention of Your Personal Data

We retain Personal Data or Usage Data only as long as necessary for the purposes described (e.g., resolving support requests or improving the Service). Since health data is not collected, it is not retained. Usage Data, if collected, is retained briefly for analysis and deleted unless required for legal obligations (e.g., resolving disputes).

### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Since We do not collect or store health data, no health data is transferred. If We collect limited Usage Data (e.g., crash reports), it may be processed in the United States by Us or Service Providers. By using the Service, You consent to any such data being processed in the United States, which may have different data protection laws than Your jurisdiction (e.g., Canada or the EU). We ensure any data transfers comply with applicable laws, such as GDPR for EU users, using appropriate safeguards.

### Delete Your Personal Data

You may request deletion of any Personal Data We hold (e.g., Usage Data) by contacting Us. Since health data remains on Your Device, You can manage it through Your Device settings (e.g., revoking HealthKit permissions). You may also delete Your Account, if applicable, via the Service’s settings to remove any associated data.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

We may disclose Personal Data or Usage Data, if collected, in the following cases:

- Business Transactions: If the Developer is involved in a merger or acquisition, Your data may be transferred with notice.
- Law Enforcement: If required by law or valid public authority requests (e.g., courts).
- Other Legal Requirements: To comply with legal obligations, protect Our rights, prevent wrongdoing, or ensure user safety.

### Security of Your Personal Data

Since We do not collect or store health data, its security is managed by Your Device. For any Personal Data or Usage Data We may collect, We use commercially acceptable security measures, but no internet transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy

Our Service is restricted to users over the age of 18, as stated in Our Terms and Conditions. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from anyone under 18. If You are a parent or guardian and believe Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us, and We will remove such data from Our systems.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third-party link, You will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

We will inform You via email or an in-app notice before changes take effect, updating the “Last updated” date above. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes are effective when posted.
