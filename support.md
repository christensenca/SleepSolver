## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### My Sleep Data Is Not Showing

SleepSolver requires an Apple Watch to function properly, as it is optimized to pull sleep and activity data directly from Apple Health via your Apple Watch. Please confirm that you are using an Apple Watch and that it is properly synced with Apple Health. If you're using another fitness device, note that SleepSolver currently does not support other devices that sync with Apple Health.

### How Do I Manage My Subscriptions?

SleepSolver subscriptions are managed through Apple's settings, not within the SleepSolver app. To view or manage your subscription, go to your iPhone's Settings app, tap your name, then select "Subscriptions" to make changes.

### Recovery Metrics Not Showing

Recovery metrics require at least 7 days of sleep data to establish an accurate baseline. Please check if you have tracked sleep for at least 7 days using your Apple Watch synced with Apple Health. The recovery view in SleepSolver should indicate how many days remain until the baseline is set.

### Correlations Trends Not Showing

Correlations trends require more than 7 days of sleep and habit data to display. Check that you have at least 7 days of data tracked in SleepSolver, and verify that the charts indicate this requirement. Additionally, ensure the correct chart is selected by clicking the "Filter Data" option dropdown in the app and confirming your desired chart is active.
