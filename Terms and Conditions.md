## Acknowledgment

These are the Terms and Conditions governing the use of this Service and the agreement that operates between You and the Developer. These Terms are concluded between You and the Developer, not the Application Store, and the Developer is solely responsible for the Application and its content. These Terms and Conditions set out the rights and obligations of all users regarding the use of the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service You agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions then You may not access the Service.

You represent that you are over the age of 18. The Developer does not permit those under 18 to use the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is also conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with the Privacy Policy of the Developer. Our Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information when You use the Application or the Website and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

## Subscriptions

### Subscription period

The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly or annually), depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.

At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Developer cancels it at least 24 hours before the renewal date via Your App Store account settings.

### Free Features

Certain features of the Service are available without a paid Subscription. These free features may include limited access to sleep tracking or analytics and are subject to these Terms and Conditions.

### Cancellation of Subscription

You may cancel Your Subscription by downgrading through the Apple App Store. Subscription cancellation takes effect at the end of Your current billing cycle. When Your Subscription ends, Your account will change to a free membership. You can reactivate Your Subscription at any time under Your existing account without having to open a new account, although Subscription fees may have changed.

### Billing

You shall provide the Developer with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information, processed through Apple’s In-App Purchase system, which may use Apple Pay.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Developer will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

### Fee Changes

The Developer, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.

The Developer will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

### Refunds

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable (e.g., Ontario’s Consumer Protection Act mandates refunds within 30 days for non-delivery of services).

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Developer on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Developer.

### Free Trial

The Developer may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited period of time.

You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged by the Developer until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless You canceled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.

At any time and without notice, the Developer reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

All data processing occurs on Your Device, in compliance with Apple’s HealthKit guidelines and applicable privacy laws (e.g., PIPEDA, GDPR if serving EU users).

## Intellectual Property

Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of the Developer.

## Termination

We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.

Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.

## Limitation of Liability

Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Developer and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Developer or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Developer or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer

The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Developer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Developer provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Developer nor any of the Developer's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Developer are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.

## Governing Law

The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

## Disputes Resolution

If You have any concern or dispute about the Service, You agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting the Developer.

### No Class Actions

You may only resolve Disputes with the Developer on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under this agreement.

### Judicial Forum for Disputes

Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that any dispute resolution process is found not to apply to You or Your claim, You and the Developer agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Orange County, California. Both You and the Developer consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive Our right to a jury trial.

### Time Limitation on Claims

Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to Your use of the Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.

## Severability and Waiver

### Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

### Waiver

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
